# Monster Hunter World Auto-Deco-Data

The goal for this project was to create a chrome extension to automatically input your Monster Hunter World decoration data into Honey Hunter's build makers.

General user flow to be:
1) Open honey hunter page
2) Open extension
3) Select save file (and save number, because MHW save files are actually 3 separate saves in one)
4) Hit run to have the decoration data from that save auto-inserted into the Honey Hunter interface
5) Make builds with your decoration data!

Was inspired by a friend of mine who made a java applet that loads a MHW save and outputs a text file with the deco data.
See https://github.com/clicksilver/mhw_decos_csv for the java applet.

Project put on indefinite hold because I realised that bringing over the extraction / save decryption code over from the java applet would probably be very difficult. Oh well, live and learn...
